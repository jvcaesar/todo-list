Integrify React Todo Project

This is a React project for creating a list of "todo" items, that consists of a title, deadline and status. The items are added by clicking on the "Add a new todo item" which opens a modal where the user input is entered. An update to an item can be made by clicking on any item in the todo list, which again pops up the modal.

Can be easily extended to a Full-stack project.
